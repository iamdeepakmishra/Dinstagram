Sometimes I want to see some pics with zoom feature but official instagram doesn'r provide this feature so i customized it a little,
by double tapping with double finger in any image it will open it in FullZoomable view.

...........................................................................................

In this Repo i added colourful progress view to show the loading progress of images.
